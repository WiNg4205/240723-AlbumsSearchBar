# 23/07/24 - AlbumsSearchBar (#5)
This is a webpage which shows a list of the top 5000 user rated albums on [rateyourmusic.com](https://rateyourmusic.com). There is a search bar which can filter by both artist and album.

I made this using pandas and flask for the backend and react + tailwindcss for the frontend. The most difficult part of this project was using tailwindcss because I have only used it a handful of times (I normally just use plain css). My JS and CSS fundamentals were very elementary the last time I used tailwind so I am definitely more comfortable with it now. This project was initially meant for me to improve my UI skills but since I was using a lot of technologies, setting up took a while and also I was still trying to get familiar with tailwindcss. I think I will mainly use tailwindcss from now on instead of plain css for a couple of reasons.
- Speeding up coding time
- Utlity first approach removes the need to name classes
- Clear, discrete values (e.g. gray-100, gray-200, ...)
- Pretty much same capabilities of plain css except for the discrete values which I find to be a pro anyways
- Less files in the repository since there is only one css file needed
- pretty documentation page (not kidding this inspires me to learn it more)
